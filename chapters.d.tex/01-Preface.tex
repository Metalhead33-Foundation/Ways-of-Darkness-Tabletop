You are currently reading the ruleset of the \textbf{World of Artograch RPG}, a roleplaying game system intended for fantasy roleplaying in a fictional universe known as Artograch. Although it is technically a playable tabletop RPG, it is not primarily intended as such - due to the sheer number of calculations that would be very slow to perform without the aid of a graphical computing device of sorts \textit{(such as a personal computer or a smartphone)}, it is primarily intended to serve as the basis of future video game adaptations. You have been warned!\newline
