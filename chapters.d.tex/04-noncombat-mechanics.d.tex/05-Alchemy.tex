\section{Alchemy}
\textbf{Alchemy} is the art of combining ingredients to create potions which offer various effects, depending on the ingredient in question. Potions can be divided into \textbf{Class D} \Parentheses{weakest}, \textbf{Class C} \Parentheses{stonger}, \textbf{Class B} \Parentheses{even stronger} and \textbf{Class A} \Parentheses{strongest} potions. Each module will offer a list of example potions and for each tier, but otherwise, it will be up to the DM/GM to decide which \Parentheses{plot-relevant} potion belongs to which tier.

By default, characters can only craft \textbf{Class D} potions, but feats will enable stronger tiers of potion-making - in the main archmodule, that tear is called Alchemy.
