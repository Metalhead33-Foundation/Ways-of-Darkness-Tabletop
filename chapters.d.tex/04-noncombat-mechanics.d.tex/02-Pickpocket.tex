\section{Pickpocket}
Pickpocketing is to steal a small item \Parentheses{interpretation up to the DM/GM} from an NPC's - or another player character's - inventory, while undetected by the target. As with all of the aforementioned non-combat abilities that involve a dice roll, pickpocketing is impossible for characters who do not have a feat that enables it. Like with the other dice-rolling abilities, when the character attmepts to pickpocket, they must roll a d20 dice \Parentheses{or the sum of four d5 dices, or five d4 dices} - or, in case of a video game, use a random number generator to generate a number between 1 and 20. When the received number is smaller than the character's dexterity, the pickpocket attempt is succesful. Otherwise, it is a fail, and the target is alerted.
