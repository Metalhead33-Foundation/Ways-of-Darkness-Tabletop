}{A \textbf{Buckler} is a rather small shield, less than 45 cm - or 18 inches - in diameter. The small size of shield means it offers minimal protection against crushing damage, but it compensates by having increased mobility, with enemy attacks being blocked by it if $4d5 <= \frac{Dexterity}{1.1}$.\hfil \break
Bucklers also do a crushing damage of $\frac{2d4 \pm modifiers}{5}*Strength$ during a Shield Bash.

\textit{Piercing:} $+100\%$
}{A \textbf{Single-Pointed Shield} is a shield typically made out of wood, larger than a Buckler, and named as such due to being attached to its user at a single point, which sacrifices stability for mobility, causing such shields to be ease to move even at larger sizes - enemy attacks being blocked by it if $4d5 <= \frac{Dexterity}{1.3}$.\hfil \break
Single-Pointed Shields also do a crushing damage of $\frac{2d8 \pm modifiers}{5}*Strength$ during a Shield Bash.

\textit{Piercing:} $+100\%$
}{A \textbf{Double-Pointed Shield} is a shield typically made out of a mixture of wood and metal, larger than a Buckler, and named as such due to being attached to its user at two points, which sacrifices mobility for stability, making it difficult to make these shields bulge - enemy attacks being blocked by it if $4d5 <= \frac{Dexterity}{2}$.\hfil \break
Single-Pointed Shields also do a crushing damage of $\frac{2d6 \pm modifiers}{5}*Strength$ during a Shield Bash.
