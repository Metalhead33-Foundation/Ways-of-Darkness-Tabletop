Rather than a strict categorization of Good vs Neutral vs Evil and Lawful vs Neutral vs Chaotic, these two axes \textit{(Good vs Evil, Lawful vs Chaotic)} are tracked on a floating-point coordinate system, where both the X axis \textit{(Good vs Evil)} and Y axis \textit{(Lawful vs Chaotic)} go from 1.0 to -1.0, with 0.0 at both axes representing true neutrality. This is done, so that alignment shifts can be tracked. Nevertheless, to map to the classical system of 9 alignments:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lawful characters are between 1.0 and 0.33 on the lawfullness scale, Neutral characters are between 0.3325 and -0.33, Chaotic characters are between -0.33 and -1.0 on the lawfullness scale.
\item Good characters are between 1.0 and 0.33 on the goodness scale, Neutral characters are between 0.33 and -0.33, Evil characters are between -0.33 and -1.0 on the goodness scale.
\item For the sake of convenience and simplicity, at some places, I will still refer to the classical 9-alignment system, and will detail each nine of them below:
