\chapter{The Character Sheet}
\textbf{Characters} form the basis of the World of Artograch RPG \textemdash each player must control a character \textit{(or potentially a group of characters)}, while the dungeon master controls a multitude of \textbf{non-player characters}. Each notable character has a \textbf{character sheet}, which contains game-relevant information about the character. Such informatio includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item The character's name
\item The character's sex
\item The character's age in days. It is important to give it in days instead of years, because Artograch's calenders work differently from Terran calendars, there being 376 days per year instead of the Terran 365.25. This should be the chronological age, but for ease of computation, the biological age can also be cached.
\item The character's religion \textit{(gameplay-wise only relevant for characters who use Clerical Magic)}. This is optional, as character can also be atheists, following no religion at all.
\item The character's race
\item The character's background \textit{(if the character has one)}
\item The character's attributes \textit{(we'll talk about it later)}
\item The character's feats \textit{(we'll talk about it later)}
\item The character's number of hitpoints \textit{(per bodypart)}, spellpoints and stamina
\item The character's equipment and inventory
\item The character's spells \textit{(if the character has any)}
\item The character's status effects \textit{(if the character has any)}
\item Any miscellaneous information that has limited relevance gameplay-wise \textit{(character biography, relationships with other characters, trivial information, etc.)}
\end{itemize}
