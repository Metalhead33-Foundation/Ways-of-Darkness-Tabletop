\section{Sex}
This attribute of the character determines the character's \textbf{biological sex}, regardless of what they identify with. For the majority of races, there are only two biological sexes: male and female. However, for some races, there may be more than that, or even no sexes at all \textit{(for races that rely on asexual reproduction)}.\newline
Depending on the race, certain sexes may come with certain advantages or disadvantages \textemdash for example, human males tend to be stronger \textit{(higher strength and endurance)}, while human females tend to be more nimble and intricate \textit{(higher dexterity and charisma)}.
For NPCs, their sex will typically also, to a certain extent determine their behaviour. Among other things, unless explicitly defined as homosexual or bisexual \textit{(or under the influence of either magical mind-control or a character with exceptionally high charisma)}, NPCs will typically be immune to seduction attempt by members of their own sex.
