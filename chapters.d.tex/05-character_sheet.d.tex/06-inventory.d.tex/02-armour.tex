\subsection{Armour}
Armour occupies various parts of the body, and can often be combined to constitute multiple stacking layers. The primary goal of armour is to provide resistance against attacks, primarily physical ones \textit{(tho enchanted armour may offer magic resistance)}. If we assume that a character's outfit - excluding jewellry - consists of a maximum of 6 \textit{slots/layers} \textit{(underwear, shirt, sweater, coat or gambeson, chainmail or leather armour, and finally a breastplate)}.

A typical armour template will look like this:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|C{2cm} L{2cm} L{2cm} L{8cm}|}
\hline
\large{\textbf{Name}} &
\large{\textbf{Cost}} &
\large{\textbf{Slot}} &
\large{\textbf{Resistance}}
\\ \hline
\WeaponRow{Armour Name}{Armour Cost}{Armour Slot}{Resistances}{Armour type description.}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
