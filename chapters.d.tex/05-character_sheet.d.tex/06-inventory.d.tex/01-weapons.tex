\subsection{Weapons}
Weapons are tools occupying the hands that are used to inflict damage on hostile combatants. They come in many flavours: one-handed and two-handed, ranged and melee, primitive and complex. In the World of Artograch system, each weapon can inflict multiple different types of damage simultaneously. To sum it all up, a weapon's attributes include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Handedness:} Whether the weapon can be physically wielded in one hand or not. For all intents and purposes, \textit{hand-a-half swords / bastard swords} will be classified as one-handed, even if they aren't very practical for one-handed use by weaker swordsmen. The majority of ranged weapons are two-handed.
  \item \textbf{Rangedness:} Whether the weapon is a melee weapon or a \textit{ranged weapon / projectile-based weapon}.
  \item \textbf{Group:} In addition to the previous four potential groups, \textit{(one-handed, two-handed, melee, projectile)}, a weapon can be part of various other groups as well. Think of it as a tag. This is primarily used to keep track of which kind of weapons do the various feats augment. Modules can introduce whole new weapon groups and corresponding feats.
  \item \textbf{Damage:} A list of damages the weapon applies to its targets. Do keep in mind that most weapons simultaneously apply two kinds of damage, albeit at a different ratio.
\end{enumerate}
