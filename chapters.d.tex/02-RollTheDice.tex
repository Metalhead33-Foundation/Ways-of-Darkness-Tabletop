\chapter{Roll the dice!}
World of Artograch - in spite of being intended more to serve as the base of CRPG adaptations, rather than a tabletop RPG meant to be played among friends - is, at the end of the day, still a tabletop RPG, as such, it is only expected that it will rely on dice-rolls to determine things. Events will be generally detailed in percentages rather than dice rolls by default, but game masters are expected to adapt this to dice rolls: for example, if we state that character has 50\% of succeeding at a task, the game master must ask the character's controller to roll the dice. If it's a 20-sided dice, they must roll 10 or greater, if it's a 6-sided dice, they must roll 3 or greater, and so on. House rules. Nevertheless, for the sake of convenience, sometimes, dice measurements will be also given.
