\section{Ranged Attack}
\textbf{Ranged Attacks} are attacks done from afar with projectile-based weaponry. whether it be a simple rock or an arrow. Because attacking enemies afar requires much greater precision than attacking enemies up close, there is usually a much greater Dexterity-malus for untrained use of ranged weapons. Realistically, distance should also be a factor, but as this system won't even create a grid or map system, it will be up to the DM's discresion to decide how much will distance affect accuracy.\newline
Without any skills or feats to negate it, using ranged weapons while on a moving mount grants a \Malus{4} to Dexterity.
