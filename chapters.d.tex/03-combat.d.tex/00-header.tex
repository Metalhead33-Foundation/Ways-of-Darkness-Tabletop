\chapter{Combat}
\textbf{Combat} has an ugly tendency to be at the forefront of most roleplaying games, be they pen-and-paper or computer-based. Whether we like it or not, most roleplayers expect combat to happen at one point or another in the campaign. As such, it is necessary to offer a clear guidline on how combat works in the World of Artograch roleplaying system.\newline
Observance of the guidline should depend on the nature of the game being played: treating this roleplaying system as a genuine pen-and-paper tabletop RPG warrants a turn-based system. Likewise, should a game developer decide to adapt this system and take inspiration from the \textit{Baldur's Gate} series, \textit{Icewind Dale} series, \textit{Planescape: Torment}, \textit{Arcanum} or \textit{Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic}, the aforementioned turn-based system can be and should be faithfully adapted. Should the game developer instead choose to create a looser adaptation combined with gameplay inspired by the \textit{Elder Scrolls} or the \textit{Gothic} series \textemdash which is precisely what the author of this document intends in the future \textemdash then the turn-based system that is to be documented in the following pages is to be discarded entirely, as the only thing that should dictate the pace of combat in an action-RPG should be the length of weapon animations.
