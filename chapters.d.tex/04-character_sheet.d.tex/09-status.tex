\section{Status effects}
\textbf{Status effects} encapsulate the various modifiers affecting the character, be it passive and unnoticeable, or active, temporary and very much visible. Status effects influence the character's attributes, strengthen or weaken magic used by the character, disable certain equipment slots, influence the character's combat capabilities \textit{(some negative status effects render a character temporarily unable to act at all, forcing them to skip turns until the status effect is removed)}.
