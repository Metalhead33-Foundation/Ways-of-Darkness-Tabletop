\section{Feats}
\textbf{Feats} encapsulate the character's learned skills. Some feats give the character special abilities, some give mundane bonuses, while others may be necessary to commit certain actions \textit{(either commit them at all, or commit them without serious penalties)}. Most backgrounds give character certain starting feats. Some feats may be unique to certain backgrounds, or disallowed for certain backgrounds.
