\section{Background}
Unlike in other roleplaying games, there are no classes - however, instead of them, there are character backgrounds, which impose far lesser limitations on characters than classes would in classic roleplaying systems. They typically grant the characters bonus feats, a number of feats to choose at the start, bonus attributes, and various other potential bonuses - but also maluses: most backgrounds also reduce some attributes, slow down experience gain, and some may even forbid certain select feats. Some backgrounds may also grant unique feats that cannot be achieved without that background. Additionally, backgrounds also control starting money and equipment.\newline
Classical classes can be emulated via so-called \textit{"builds"}, which are optional instructions and character templates.\newline
Unless stated otherwise, all backgrounds start with 16 feat points that can be spent freely.
